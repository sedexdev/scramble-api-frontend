# Sramble

This repo contains the frontend application code for the Scramble API. 
The API allows you to encrypt text and files quickly and easily. You can 
share encrypted files and text with others by sharing decryption keys to
encrypted content. You can also create key pairs for personal encryption
as well as creating hash digests for passwords and sensitive data.
